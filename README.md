### 🪴 About the Project

This project was created as part of my academic studies and focuses on applying programming and algorithmic thinking in a practical way.
I worked on it to strengthen my understanding of clean code design, data handling, and problem-solving through structured logic.

### ⚙️ Main Technologies

Python, NumPy, Pandas

### 💡 What Makes It Unique

This project reflects a real learning process — experimenting, refining, and improving along the way.
I believe that writing code is not just a technical skill but also a way to build clarity of thought, and that’s exactly what I aimed for here.
